This directory contains sample programs for the cc65 compiler.

Below is a short description for each of the programs together with a list of
the supported platforms.

Please note:

  * The supplied makefile needs with GNU make. It works out of the box on
    Linux and similar systems. If you're using Windows, you will have to
    compile the programs manually.

  * The makefile specifies the C64 as the default target platform, because all
    of the programs run on this platform. When compiling for another platform,
    you will have to change the line that specifies the target system at the
    top of the makefile.
