Many special thanks go to the guy who started it all:

		   	John R.Dunning.

Without his great work, there would not be a single freeware C crosscompiler
for the 6502 out there. He built the grounds for this cc65 and some other cc65
implementations and a lot of his code is still in the current compiler.



More special thanks to:

  * Keith W. Gerdes <kwg@freebird.ghofn.org>

    Without his outstanding help, the assembler/compiler wouldn't be, what it
    is now. He helped with suggestions, bug reports and even kicked me here
    and then, when I started to get too lazy:-)

  * Tennessee Carmel-Veilleux <veilleux@ameth.org>

    Tennessee worked on the NES port.

  * Kevin Ruland <kevin@rodin.wustl.edu>

    Kevin did the Apple 2 port and found at least one serious error in the
    C library while doing so.

  * Christian Groessler <cpg@aladdin.de>

    Christian sent me several fixes for 64 bit machines.

  * Sidney Cadot <sidney@ch.twi.tudelft.nl>

    Sidney rewrote the random number generator.

  * Maciej Witkowiak <ytm@friko.onet.pl>

    Maciej is responsible for the GEOS support.

  * MicroSystems Development Technologies Inc. located in San Jose,
    California payed me for the addition of several assembler features,
    which went also into the freeware version. These guys are selling
    nice hardware devices like EPROM emulators. If you are developing
    hardware or embedded microcontroller applications, you should have
    a look at their web site at www.msd.com.
