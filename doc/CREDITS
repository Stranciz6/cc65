Many special thanks go to the guy who started it all:

		   	John R. Dunning

Without his great work, there would not be a single freeware C crosscompiler
for the 6502 out there. He built the grounds for this cc65 and some other cc65
implementations and a lot of his code is still in the current compiler.



More special thanks to:

  * Keith W. Gerdes <kwg@freebird.ghofn.org>

    Without his outstanding help, the assembler/compiler wouldn't be, what it
    is now. He helped with suggestions, bug reports and even kicked me here
    and then, when I started to get too lazy:-)

  * Tennessee Carmel-Veilleux <veilleux@ameth.org>

    Tennessee worked on the NES port (which is unfinished and was removed
    because having an unfinished port it was confusing and people started
    mailing me about it).

  * Kevin Ruland <kevin@rodin.wustl.edu>

    Kevin did the Apple 2 port and found at least one serious error in the
    C library while doing so.

  * Christian Groessler <cpg@aladdin.de>
    Mark Keates <markk@dendrite.co.uk>
    Freddy Offenga <taf_offenga@yahoo.com>
    David Lloyd <dmlloyd@atari-central.com>

    The team that added support for the Atari 8 bit machines.
    Christian Groessler also sent me several fixes for 64 bit machines.

  * Sidney Cadot <sidney@ch.twi.tudelft.nl>

    Sidney rewrote the random number generator.

  * Maciej Witkowiak <ytm@friko.onet.pl>

    Maciej wrote the GEOS support libraries for cc65.

  * Eric Au <eric_au@hotmail.com>

    Eric is one of the most active testers, and supplied me with dozens of
    bug reports.

  * MicroSystems Development Technologies Inc. located in San Jose,
    California payed me for the addition of several assembler features,
    which went also into the freeware version. These guys are selling
    nice hardware devices like EPROM emulators. If you are developing
    hardware or embedded microcontroller applications, you should have
    a look at their web site at www.msd.com.
