<abstract>
da65 is a 6502/65C02 disassembler that is able to read user supplied
information about its input data for better results. The output is ready for
feeding into ca65, the macro assembler supplied with the cc65 C compiler.

<sect>Overview<p>

da65 is a disassembler for 6502/65C02 code. It is supplied as a utility with
the cc65 C compiler and generates output that is suitable for the ca65
macro assembler.

Besides generating output for ca65, one of the design goals was that the user
is able to feed additional information about the code into the disassembler
for improved results. This information may include the location and size of
tables, and their format.

One nice advantage of this concept is that disassembly information for
copyrighted binaries may be handled without problems: One can just pass the
information file for disassembling the binary, so everyone with a legal copy
of the binary can generate a nicely formatted disassembly with readable labels
and other information.


<sect>Usage<p>


<sect1>Command line option overview<p>

The assembler accepts the following options:

<tscreen><verb>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage: da65 [options] file
Short options:
  -g                    Add debug info to object file
  -h                    Help (this text)
  -o name               Name the output file
  -v                    Increase verbosity
  -F                    Add formfeeds to the output
  -S addr               Set the start/load address
  -V                    Print the disassembler version

Long options:
  --cpu type            Set cpu type
  --debug-info          Add debug info to object file
  --formfeeds           Add formfeeds to the output
  --help                Help (this text)
  --pagelength n        Set the page length for the listing
  --start-addr addr     Set the start/load address
  --verbose             Increase verbosity
  --version             Print the disassembler version
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
</verb></tscreen>


<sect1>Command line options in detail<p>

Here is a description of all the command line options:

<descrip>

  <label id="option--cpu">
  <tag><tt>--cpu type</tt></tag>

  Set the CPU type. The option takes a parameter, which may be one of

       	6502, 65SC02, 65C02

  Support for the 65816 is currently not available.


  <label id="option--formfeeds">
  <tag><tt>-F, --formfeeds</tt></tag>

  Add formfeeds to the generated output. This feature is useful together
  with the <tt><ref id="option--pagelength" name="--pagelength"></tt> option.
  If <tt/--formfeeds/ is given, a formfeed is added to the output after each
  page.


  <tag><tt>-g, --debug-info</tt></tag>

  This option adds the <tt/.DEBUGINFO/ command to the output file, so the
  assembler will generate debug information when reassembling the generated
  output.


  <tag><tt>-h, --help</tt></tag>

  Print the short option summary shown above.


  <tag><tt>-o name</tt></tag>

  The default output name is the name of the input file with the extension
  replaced by ".dis". If you don't like that, you may give another name with
  the -o option. The output file will be placed in the same directory as
  the source file, or, if -o is given, the full path in this name is used.


  <label id="option--pagelength">
  <tag><tt>--pagelength n</tt></tag>

  Sets the length of a listing page in lines. After this number of lines, a
  new page header is generated. If the <tt><ref id="option--formfeeds"
  name="--formfeeds"></tt> is also given, a formfeed is inserted before
  generating the page header.

  A value of -1 for the page length will disable paging of the output.


  <tag><tt>-S addr, --start-addr addr</tt></tag>

  Specify the start/load address of the binary code that is going to be
  disassembled. The given address is interpreted as an octal value if
  preceeded with a '0' digit, as a hexadecimal value if preceeded with '0x',
  '0X', or '$', and as a decimal value in all other cases. If no start address
  is specified, 0xC000 is used - which is often not what you want.


  <tag><tt>-v, --verbose</tt></tag>

  Increase the assembler verbosity. Usually only needed for debugging
  purposes. You may use this option more than one time for even more
  verbose output.


  <tag><tt>-V, --version</tt></tag>

  Print the version number of the assembler. If you send any suggestions
  or bugfixes, please include the version number.
