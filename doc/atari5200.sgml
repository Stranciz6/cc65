<sect>Overview<p>

This file contains an overview of the Atari 5200 runtime system as it comes
with the cc65 C compiler. It describes the memory layout, Atari 5200 specific header
files, available drivers, and any pitfalls specific to that platform.

Please note that Atari 5200 specific functions are just mentioned here, they are
described in detail in the separate <url url="funcref.html" name="function
reference">. Even functions marked as "platform dependent" may be available on
more than one platform. Please see the function reference for more
information.


<sect>Binary format<p>

The standard binary output format generated by the linker for the Atari 5200 target
is a cartridge image. It is of course
possible to change this behaviour by using a modified startup file and linker
config.

<sect>Memory layout<p>

cc65 generated programs with the default setup run with the I/O area and a
CHR bank enabled, which gives a usable memory range of &dollar;8000 - &dollar;FFF3.
All boot ROM entry points may be called directly without additional code.

Special locations:

<descrip>
  <tag/Text screen/
  The text screen is located at VRAM &dollar;2000.

  <tag/Stack/
  The C runtime stack is located at &dollar;7FFF and growing downwards.

  <tag/Heap/
  The C heap is located at the end of the program and grows towards the C
  runtime stack.

</descrip><p>



<sect>Platform specific header files<p>

Programs containing Atari 5200 specific code may use the <tt/atari5200.h/ header file.


<sect1>Atari 5200 specific functions<p>

<itemize>
<item>???
</itemize>



<sect1>Hardware access<p>

The following pseudo variables declared in the <tt/nes.inc/ include file do
allow access to hardware located in the address space.

<descrip>

  <tag><tt/PPU/</tag>
  The <tt/PPU/ defines allow access to the PPU chip.

  <tag><tt/APU/</tag>
  The <tt/APU/ defines allow access to the APU chip.

</descrip><p>



<sect>Loadable drivers<p>

All drivers must be statically linked because no file I/O is available.
The names in the parentheses denote the symbols to be used for static linking of the drivers.


<sect1>Graphics drivers<p>

<descrip>

No graphics drivers are currently available for the Atari 5200.

</descrip><p>


<sect1>Extended memory drivers<p>

No extended memory drivers are available for the Atari 5200.


<sect1>Joystick drivers<p>

<descrip>

  <tag><tt/atr5200std.joy (atr5200std_joy)/</tag>
  A joystick driver for the standard Atari 5200 joystick is available. Up to four joysticks can be attached.

</descrip><p>


<sect1>Mouse drivers<p>

No mouse drivers are available for the Atari 5200.


<sect1>RS232 device drivers<p>

No serial drivers are available for the Atari 5200.



<sect>Limitations<p>

<sect1>Disk I/O<p>

The existing library for the Atari 5200 doesn't implement C file
I/O. There are no hacks for the <tt/read()/ and <tt/write()/ routines.

To be more concrete, this limitation means that you cannot use any of the
following functions (and a few others):

<itemize>
<item>fclose
<item>fopen
<item>fread
<item>fprintf
<item>fputc
<item>fscanf
<item>fwrite
<item>...
</itemize>
