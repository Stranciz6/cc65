List of known bugs that will not get fixed before any new major release:

  * The compiler does not detect if part of an expression evaluated
    with && or || is constant. Since the expression evaluation is also
    used for the preprocessor, this defeats the use of

    	#if defined(x) && defined(y)

  * Initialization of local variables with compound data types is not
    possible.

Introduced with version 2.5:

  * Use of "goto" to jump into or out of blocks that declare local variables
    will create programs that crash, since the stack is not corrected. The old
    stack correction code was removed because of the restructuring of the
    symbol table stuff and was not reintroduced because it was ugly anyway,
    did not work with the new symbol table code, and should be unnecessary as
    soon as local variables are allocated in one chunk on function entry.

  * Register variables are currently unavailable. The command line switches
    and the "register" keyword is still accepted, so this should not harm
    existing programs.
