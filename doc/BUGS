List of known bugs that will not get fixed in the near future:

  * The compiler does not detect if part of an expression evaluated
    with && or || is constant. Since the expression evaluation is also
    used for the preprocessor, this defeats the use of

    	#if defined(x) && defined(y)

  * Initialization of local variables with compound data types is not
    possible.
