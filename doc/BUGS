Introduced with version 2.5:

  * Use of "goto" to jump into or out of blocks that declare local variables
    will create programs that crash, since the stack is not corrected. The old
    stack correction code was removed because of the restructuring of the
    symbol table stuff and was not reintroduced because it was ugly anyway,
    did not work with the new symbol table code, and should be unnecessary as
    soon as local variables are allocated in one chunk on function entry.
