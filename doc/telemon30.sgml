compiler.

<sect>Overview<p>

This file contains an overview of the Telestrat runtime system as it comes with the
cc65 C compiler. It describes the memory layout, Telemon3.0-specific header files,
available drivers, and any pitfalls specific to that platform.

Please note that Telemon3.0-specific functions are just mentioned here, they are
described in detail in the separate <url url="funcref.html" name="function
reference">. Even functions marked as "platform dependent" may be available on
more than one platform. Please see the function reference for more
information.



<sect>Binary format<p>

The standard binary output format generated by the linker for the Telemon 3.0 target
is a machine language program with a 20 bytes header described here : http://orix.oric.org/doku.php?id=orix:header



<sect>Memory layout<p>

In the standard setup, cc65-generated programs use the memory from
&dollar;0801 to &dollar;9800; so, nearly 37K of memory (including the stack) is
available. ROM calls are possible without further precautions.



Special locations:

<descrip>
  <tag/Stack/
  The C runtime stack is located at &dollar;97FF (or &dollar;B3FF), and grows
  downwards.

  <tag/Heap/
  The C heap is located at the end of the program, and grows towards the C
  runtime stack.

</descrip><p>



<sect>Platform-specific header files<p>

Programs containing Telemon 3.0 -specific code may use the <tt/telemon.h/ header file.


<sect1>Telemon 3.0-specific functions<p>

The functions listed below are special for the Telemon 3.0. See the <url
url="funcref.html" name="function reference"> for declaration and usage.

<itemize>
<item>explode
<item>ping
<item>shoot
<item>zap
<item>oupsx
</itemize>


<sect1>Hardware access<p>

The following pseudo variables declared in the <tt/atmos.h/ header file do allow
access to hardware located in the address space. Some variables are
structures; accessing the struct fields will access the chip registers.

<descrip>

  <tag><tt/VIA/</tag>
  Access to the VIA (Versatile Interface Adapter) chip is available via the
  <tt/VIA/ variable. The structure behind this variable is explained in <tt/_6522.h/.

</descrip><p>



<sect>Loadable drivers<p>

<em>Note:</em> Since the Atmos doesn't have working disk I/O
(see <ref id="limitations" name="section &quot;Limitations&quot;">), the
available drivers cannot be loaded at runtime (so the term "loadable drivers"
is somewhat misleading). Instead, the drivers have to be statically linked. While
this may seem overhead, it has two advantages:


<sect1>Extended memory drivers<p>

No extended memory drivers are currently available for the Atmos.


<sect1>Joystick drivers<p>

<descrip>

telemon 3.0 manages joysticks but it had been handled yet.

</descrip><p>


<sect1>Mouse drivers<p>

Telemon 3.0 manages also mouse, but it had been no handled yet in this version.

<sect1>RS232 device drivers<p>

<descrip>

not done

</descrip><p>



<sect>Limitations<label id="limitations"><p>

<sect1>Disk I/O<p>

This version handles fopen, fread, fclose primitives. Because Telemon 3.0 handles these two primitives. By the way, 
it uses an extension "ch376 card" which handles sdcard and FAT 32 usb key.

<itemize>
<item>fclose
<item>fopen
<item>fread

</itemize>
